# Code-Summarization-using-GPT-4

This repo contains code for a webpage UI that takes a code snippet as input and gives you the summarization of the code as output.
This project is built using react.js, SQL, python and GPT-4 for summarization.

# How to run the project?
I suggest you to create a virtual environment to run this project because its always a optimal way to work on projects.
1. After creating the venv run requirements.txt file which is in the Backend directory

   pip install -r path_to_requirements.txt
   
2. Create a SQL database and update its details in database.py file to store details of users and to support the login functionality.
3. Use the SQL command in SQL.txt file to create table in database.
4. Use npm i command to install all the required packages.
5. Use Uvicorn app:app â€”reload command to launch the LLM server.
6. Then at last use npm start command to initiate the frontend application.



These commands will typically start a development server for your frontend code, allowing you to access the webpage in your browser.
